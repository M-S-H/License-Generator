	License Generator
	Michael Hickman
-------------------------------------

The License Generator reads an owl ontology saved in and rdf/xml format and uses it to generate an xml license.

Although there is some freedom as to what the ontology can look like, a fairly restricve format is assumed. There must be two subclasses of Thing: MashupEntity and Mashup Properties.
Under Mashup Properties, there must be three sublcasses: ComparableProperty, EquitableProperty, and SetProperty. zUnder MashupEntity is where more freedom is allowed.
Classes can be created to serve as catagories for the actual restriction classes. These classes contain the individuals that are the properties that are reasoned over. These classes must also
be subclasses of ComparableProperty, EquitableProperty, or SetProperty.

Once the program is run, the user will be propmted to enter the name of an owl ontology that is in the same directory. The user will then be guided through building the license by choosing a
value for the different properties, and a function accocciated with it.

To run the program, within the 'license generator' directory, run 'ruby generator.rb'
Right now, the two ontologies that are in the directory are 'mashup.rdf' and 'student.rdf' The mashup example is the one pramod wrote, and the student ontology I created as another example.
(The idea was to reason over scholarships intead of Resources in the like in mashup example)
